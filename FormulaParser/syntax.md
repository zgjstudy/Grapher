Variables are surround by a pair of apostrophes
> Variable X should be 'X'

Transcendental Functions can be represent by their name, and follows a pair of brackets. Here are supports funcions
> sin('x') &nbsp;cos('x') &nbsp; sec('x') &nbsp; csc('x') &nbsp; tan('x') &nbsp; cot('x')

> arcsin('x') &nbsp; arccos('x') &nbsp; arctan('x')

>ln('x')

These functions can be combinas to a composite function
>sin(ln('x'))

Besides, normal Logarithmic Function should be represented in this way
>log('b','x')

Constances directly be number
>5

>4+(9/3)

Power funciton use operator "^"
>'x'^'y' &nbsp; 'z'^5

Others supported operator listed as follow
> *+*&nbsp;-&nbsp;*&nbsp;/&nbsp;()&nbsp;
