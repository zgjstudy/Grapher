Transcendental Functions can be represent by their name, and follows a pair of brackets. Here are supports funcions
> sin('x') &nbsp;cos('x') &nbsp;tan('x') &nbsp;arcsin('x') &nbsp; arccos('x') &nbsp; arctan('x')

>ln('x') &nbsp;lg('x')

These functions can be combinas to a composite function
>sin(ln('x'))

Besides, normal Logarithmic Function should be represented in this way
>log('b','x')

And power function such as x^5 should be
>power('x',5)

Constances directly be number
>5

>4+(9/3)

Others supported operator listed as follow
> *+*&nbsp;-&nbsp;*&nbsp;/&nbsp;()&nbsp;
